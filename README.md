## Getting Started

To start the complete project (database + backend + frontend), please follow the detailed instructions in the `src/README.md` file.

## Using the Application

### Person Selection

1. After starting the application, you'll need to select a person type from the top bar to access role-specific features.

2. Click on the person selector in the top navigation bar and choose a person with the appropriate role:
   - **Student**: For submitting thesis proposals
   - **Coordinator**: For managing thesis proposals, assigning jury presidents, and signing documents
   - **SC**: For approving jury proposals
   - **Staff**: For submitting documents to Fenix

3. Once you've selected a person, the sidebar menu will update to show the actions available for that role.

4. You can change the selected person at any time to access different role-specific features.

### Database Population

The system includes a sample data script (`populate.sql`) that can be used to populate the database with test data. Alternatively, you can use the "Criar Pessoas de Exemplo" button in the People management section to create sample users.
